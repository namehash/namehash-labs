This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Environment Variables

This project requires environment variables to run correctly. These variables are used to configure various aspects of the application, such as external API connections and application settings.

Below is a list of the required environment variables:

- `FORM_SUBMISSION_SLACK_WEBHOOK`: This variable holds the URL for the Slack webhook used for form submission notifications.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

To set these environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the variables like so:

FORM_SUBMISSION_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


Replace the webhook URL with the actual Slack webhook URL.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
